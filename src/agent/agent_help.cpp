  anoa terminal [options]           watch and drive one from this terminal

  The browser is the session. Every command below attaches to one that is
  already running and leaves it running, so the page, the cookies and the
  scroll position survive between them.

  Starting one:
    -p, --port <n>                  CDP port (default 9222; also uses n+1, n+2)
    --headless                      no window, and no display server needed
    --no-sandbox                    disable the Chromium sandbox
    --width <px> / --height <px>    viewport size (default 1280x720)
    --profile <name>                named profile: its own cookies and storage
    --profile-dir <dir>             where profiles live
    --extension <path>              load an unpacked extension (repeatable)
    --auth-token <secret>           require this bearer token on CDP
    --embed-origin <origin>         let this origin iframe the live view at
                                    /render (repeatable; default same-origin)
    --download-dir <dir>            where downloads land (default: Downloads)
    --proxy <url>                   route the browser through a proxy:
                                    host:port, or scheme://user:pass@host:port
    --proxy-bypass <list>           hosts that skip it, comma separated
    --max-renderers <n>             cap Chromium renderer processes; fewer
                                    processes is less memory, less parallelism
    --config <file>                 JSON or INI file of the above
    -v, --version                   print the version and exit

  Watching one (`anoa terminal`):
    --term-host <host>              host to view (default 127.0.0.1)
    --term-port <n>                 port to view (default 9222)
    --term-token <secret>           bearer token for the viewed endpoint
    --cdp <url>                     attach to any external CDP endpoint instead
    --fps <n>                       refresh rate, 1-120 (default 30)
    --gfx <mode>                    auto | halfblock | iterm | kitty

  Given no target at all, `anoa terminal` attaches to a browser already on 9222
  and hosts its own only when there is none.

  Reaching a browser from an agent command:
    --port <n> / --host <h>         where it is listening (default 127.0.0.1:9222)
    --token <secret>                its bearer token, if it demands one
    --tab <id>                      which tab to act on (default: the active one)

  Sessions:
    Cookies and logins are kept between runs, in a profile named "default"
    under your platform's application data directory.
    --profile <name>                use a different one
    --profile-dir <dir>             keep profiles somewhere else
    --ephemeral                     keep nothing; gone when the process ends)"},

    {"tabs", "TABS  — one browser, many pages", R"(  anoa tab new [url]                open a tab, print its id
      --name <name>                 call it something; --tab takes it after
      --profile <name>              give it its own persistent cookies
      --isolated                    give it a throwaway jar, gone with the tab
  anoa tab list                     every tab; * marks the active one
  anoa tab select <id>              make a tab the active one
  anoa tab close <id>               close a tab (the last one cannot be closed)

  --tab takes an id or a name, so `--tab search` and `--tab t2` can be the same
  tab. A name is an alias: the id keeps working.

  Every other command takes --tab <id> and acts on the active tab without it,
  so `anoa --tab t2 get text` reads tab 2 while tab 1 keeps doing its own work.
  Tabs share one cookie jar unless asked otherwise, which is what makes two
  logins to one site possible at the same time.)"},

  A bare argument is read as a duration when it is a number and as a selector
  otherwise, so `anoa wait 500` and `anoa wait "#results"` both do what they look
  like.)"},

  These are recorded *inside the page*, so they cover what happened before the
  command ran — a one-shot process could never have subscribed in time. The
  buffer starts empty on every page load and holds the last 500 entries.

  network covers the document, scripts, stylesheets, images and iframes as
  well as fetch and XHR. The first column is the method where one is known and
  the kind of load where none is — the browser records no verb for a
  stylesheet. A status of `-` means the response did not disclose one, which a
  cross-origin resource without Timing-Allow-Origin never does.)"},
